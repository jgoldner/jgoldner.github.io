	<h1>Good Food for Hudson provides 20 weeks of farm fresh vegetables to 55 low income families</h1>
	<p>The produce is grown with love and care at Lineage Farm using sustainable and regenerative practices and is distributed weekly. Access to affordable, fresh produce is a long standing issue in Hudson and this program seeks to address the disconnect between the bounty grown in Columbia County, and the critical issue of fresh, affordable food access for all low income families.</p>
